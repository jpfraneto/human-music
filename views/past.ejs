    <p> The past -as we understand it- is only generated by events and actions that were part of the present in a certain moment of history. The 
      only way that there can be something to display here is by you commiting to do the work and manage to go through every day with all your
      effort and discipline. Through that process, the past of this space will start being generated, and it will grow and grow. And more people
      will be inspired by what you have done, and more people will commit to create future pasts.
    </p>
