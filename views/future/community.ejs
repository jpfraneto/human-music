  <div class="container text-center content">
      <p>Community is the center of our existence as humans, and in this place the aim is to connect with the people that resonate with what
          has been built here. The idea for this place of community is to embrace conversation, embrace the creation and sharing of ideas,
          and embrace the fact that this platform has people from all over the world participating on it. I believe that by creating this
          space, people that don't feel good with their present can start feeling good. People that are unhappy can start feeling happy.
